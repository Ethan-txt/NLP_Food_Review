# Amazon Food Reviews, NLP Project March 2021


This project focuses on using NLP techniques to draw conclusions from coffee and tea reviews on Amazon from 2007 - 2012. The data used was found on kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews. Some of the techniques implemented are TTR and R to measure lexical diversity and tf-idf and cosine similarity to gauge review similarities across each year.
